# Tumble Dryer
When your [Clothes Lines](https://github.com/JamiesWhiteShirt/clothesline-fabric) don't move enough on their own, think [Tumble Dryer](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tumble-dryer).

![Tumble Dryer Example](https://i.imgur.com/RFp2UM2.png)

Adds a motor that can have an anchor placed on the axle which will then be spun when the motor is on. Doesn't move the line at maximum speed, but you wouldn't want your wet clothes on the floor would you? Motor is sensitive to being submerged in water, I wouldn't recommend doing it.
